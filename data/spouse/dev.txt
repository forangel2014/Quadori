ghosts’ brazen diversion of government revenue violation of procurement regulations non-paymentunder payment of tax by private sector operators compromised auditing of public and private sector institutions etc  Since the main objective of the study according to the briefing given to us by ActionAid was to examine and interrogate how corruption impacts on different segments of the society and the implication for social development it was obvious that we had a difficult challenge on our hands But at the end we were able to prove that in many ways the level of deprivations to which a great majority of Nigerians are subjected today is a consequence of the greed of a few people in both the private and the public sectors Interested readers can check out our report here  However in the course of our first session I raised a concern I had earlier privately discussed with Dr Abdu about the timing of our research and the sensitivity of the then government in power to such issues For some inexplicable reasons President Goodluck Jonathan was always very defensive whenever the issue of corruption in Nigeria was broached “	Dr Abdu	Goodluck Jonathan	77c632db-103a-491e-ae8c-cd7ef3aace00	-1
In a jurisprudence where the onus is placed on the person who asserts to prove it is evident that fighting corruption cannot be easy nor would recovering its proceeds be as simple as some people assume with tales of how America Britain and some Western countries would just open their vaults to release to the government money stolen by some Nigerian officials It is naïve for anybody to assume such things as it may take years for our country to get any looted funds back even if the places where they are stashed are located  Therefore while nobody is in any doubt that President Buhari given his reputation would not tolerate the kind of impunity that Nigerians have witnessed in recent years there is also nothing to suggest that things are going to change substantially under him with regards to fighting corruption Yet considering the damage corruption has done both to our national psyche and socio-economic well-being there is need for a clear roadmap on how the administration will tackle this challenge  The pertinent questions remain will the sensational stories we read in the media every day lead to the successful prosecution and conviction of some big fish in the pool of corruption to serve as deterrence to others Are institutional mechanisms being put in place to make it difficult for people to fiddle with public funds and easily get away What legaljudicial reforms are ongoing to ensure that public officials who steal billions are not asked to pay peanuts in fines to walk free How are we going to deal with the private sector that is not only the enabler for the public sector corruption but also has its own monumental rot within When are we going to get to a situation in which being invited to serve in public office would not attract celebrations and all manner of expensive social and religious thanksgivings  I pose those foregoing questions against the background of what we have been witnessing in the last three months which reveal quite clearly that if President Buhari indeed wants to fight corruption in Nigeria he still has a long way to go What worries me though is the hysteria of the moment and the backslapping by those who imagine that fighting corruption is the same as engaging in some meaningless propaganda While the force of personal example that President Buhari brings is good and naming and shaming could be helpful they on their own cannot produce any lasting results in an environment that rewards bad behaviour I will cite only three examples to buttress my position  In a sensational petition to the Osun State House of Assembly Justice Folahanmi Oloyede of the state High Court recently urged the lawmakers to investigate Governor Rauf Aregbesola allegedly for misappropriating the state’s resources and plunging it into financial crisis She also urged the House to impeach the Governor and his Deputy based on her allegation which I am not even sure was supported by any evidence	Buhari	Rauf Aregbesola	77c632db-103a-491e-ae8c-cd7ef3aace00	-1

That perhaps explains why some banks have had to tender apologies to innocent people whose names they published as debtors The simple explanation for what happened is that most of those loans were taken and shared with unscrupulous bank staff or that some bank officials did not do their work properly Yet nobody is being called to account  What I am driving at is that for an effective war against corruption in Nigeria President Buhari has to be more methodical and he needs legal and institutional support First it begins with the appointment of a competent Attorney General and then he needs certain critical institutions to be on the same page with him The EFCC Bureau of Public Procurement BPP the Federal Inland Revenue Service FIRS the Directorate of Petroleum Resources DPR and indeed all regulatory agencies of the federal government And of course he cannot win without the support of the judiciary and the National Assembly  What the President must know is that nothing compromises the fight against corruption faster than undue politicization either by his handlers or his opponents and we are already seeing evidence of that with the formation of a new “Association of Ministers who served under President Jonathan” which has joined the APC in the propaganda war “	Buhari	Jonathan	77c632db-103a-491e-ae8c-cd7ef3aace00	-1

Surprised: Several years before Jenner spoke publicly about feeling 'trapped in the wrong body,'he explained to his stepdaughter how he felt. 'I never really thought he would one day transition,' Kim wrote on her website   He told her he was going to therapy and that he wanted it to remain a secret, even going so far as to get his publicist to help him spike a  story a reporter planned to write in the 1980s referencing the cross-dressing rumors.
