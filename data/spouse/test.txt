Casual cool: The talented actor looked relaxed in baggy jeans and black leather trainers     Bulkier: He looked like he gained a good amount of weight since working on the flick      Unrecognisable: Perhaps the change has to do with the fact that he recently admitted to doping in order to 'infect' himself with former cyclist Armstrong   Perhaps the change in physical appearance has to do with the fact that he recently admitted to doping in order to 'infect' himself with former cyclist Armstrong.
